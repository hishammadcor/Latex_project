# Keep track of work:

## On 19.03.2024:
    * there is a an apporach of using Pandas and special function in it called **to_latex**. but still I do no knowhow to work with it
    * I reached to the first table by pylatex but still I can not control the colors or the size of the columns
    * Another idea of working on Latex as a string and modify it using python. its more like using regex to target certain parts of the latex text to add the content of the csv file to it. I think this will work well but still I do not know a perfect way to do it. Tomorrow we will begin.

## On 20.03.2024:
    * I going to start bu the idea of yesterday and then see the outcome at the end of the day.
    * Something rediculous happened! I can not make a good table in latex after all uuuuuhhh :\( 
    * But I think the problem will be solved uikly and chatGPT will help alot in transofrmin the Pgfplot library into late very quickely!
    * I also did not start in doing anything related to the code part, but do not forget WE HAVE TIME this is not an assignemnt! :)
    * NICI! overleaf has a number of compilations in its free mode!!! and Texmaker, even addon tex in VScode does not want to compile the file. UUUUHHHHH.
